This folder contains 2 files:

1. Evaluation_ann

This file creates an ann model using the data from the dataset and evaluates the model. It creates a file in docs/eval_results

It also creates a model in models/, yet the line is commented as we have created a cut date which is the 23rd of december 2019,
so that the data predicted is not used for the training of the model.


2. Evaluation_lstm

The same as the previous file, but it creates a lstm model instead of an ann model.
