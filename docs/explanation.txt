This folder contains the following files:

1. kaggle.json: 

The Kaggle API token used to download the dataset. The email used for this is iot2023SU@gmail.com

For installing it, use 

pip install kaggle
mkdir ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json


2. data 

This folder contains all the data used for the project. The data is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

It contains the repository used for training the model and a zip file with it. It can be updated running the realtimedata.py file.

It also contains 5 folders with the dataset prepared for each target variable, as each dataset is different slightly depending on the target variable;
for instance, when predicting humidity, temperature will be normalized, but when predicting temperature, it will not be normalized.

We did this so that when running the app, no time is spent normalizing data and so on.


3. eval_results

This file contains the results of each model trained, depending on the day trained (as each day our dataset got bigger and we could use more data for training).

It gives the rmse of each target variable for the given model and date
