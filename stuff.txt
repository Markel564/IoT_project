I have created an account in kaggle using a new gmail for this project
The email is iot2023SU@gmail.com

This will allow us to obtain the dataset in real time


For using the kaggle API, I used 

pip install kaggle
mkdir ~/.kaggle
cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json



models last saved on 23/12
dataset last updated 25/12

we can make it so that precipitation, humidity, cloud and wind speed are not 
negative, yet the purpose of the app is to show how models predict weather, and 
we would be hiding the fact that the models are not perfect
