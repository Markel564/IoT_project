This file contains the implementation of the website

We are using Flask as the web framework

The views.py file contains the routes for the website. This views are passed to the __init__.py file which 
creates the app and returns it. The file called main.py, outside this folder, is the one that runs the app.

The templates folder contains the html files for the website. The static folder contains the css and js files,
as well as the images used in the website. 

For html, we have used Jinja2 as the template engine. This allows us to pass variables from the python code to the html
and reuse html code. For example, the base.html file contains the html code that is common to all the pages

We have also used bootstrap for the css and js files. This allows us to use the bootstrap classes to style the website
properly.

python_code file contains the python code for the functions called in views.py; obtaining the models for prediction,
information such as dates, etc.
