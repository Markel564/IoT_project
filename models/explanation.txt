This folder contains the models for each target variable and machine learning algorithm

There are 10 files; 5 for LSTM and 5 for ANN

For each algorithm, we have a model saved for each target variable, which are

-- temperature_celsius
-- humidity
-- precip_mm (precipitation)
-- wind_kph (wind speed)
-- cloud (cloud cover %)
